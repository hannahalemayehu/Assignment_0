            <h3 class="subtitle">Online Creative</h3>
            <h4 class="date">November 2018</h4>
            <p>I chose to work at Tesco as they are a large company which provides customers
           the chance to do their shopping online and in stores. When I was working there
            I did a competitive analysis of other supermarket's website to see what they 
            have got which the Tesco website does not have but can be helpful for customers 
            shopping at Tesco online. When doing this I created and presented a presentation 
            which showed the features that I found on other supermarkets website and said why
            they are useful and if Tesco should include those features in their grocery’s webpages.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Barnet Group</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Web design & service</h3>
            <h4 class="date">February 2017</h4>
            <p> I chose to work at Barnet Group as I like doing actives which could be helpful to
               someone and because I like learning and understanding new things. When I was working
                there, I give feedback on how they can improve the organisation website and helped
                them improve at the same time. This was helpful for me as I was creating a website
                at the time for one the units I was doing. I also sorted parts of an excel document 
                so that one of me supervise there can get the data he needed for a report. In addition,
                I and my classmate created a PowerPoint presentation which we delivered on our last day
                on how they can improve their reports saving system. In this presentation we also created,
                and a plan view how their reports system would look. </p>

            <h2 class="title">Softwire</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">Software Development Service</h3>
            <h4 class="date">February 2016</h4>
            <p>I chose to work at Softwire as I like creating things which could be helpful to someone and
               also because I like learning and understanding new software’s I haven't used. When I was working 
               there I created an online bus time checker, which I thought was quite interesting as didn't think
                I would be able to make it within the time I was there as there is a lot of steps and codes to type
                and use. We created the bus time checker using a software called Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

           <h2 class="title">Work With A Team</h2>
           <p>I can work well in a team; this has been measured and challenged when I was doing a group
              project last year in college where we had to create a database for our client. Also this year 
              I am the group leader for a software engineering project.</p>
